# Book Scroller
## Description:

This project acts a way to navigate a book by allowing the user to select a chapter via keyboard input as well as utilizing a scrolling mechanic that allows the user to read 20 lines at a time (the scrolling feature also is utilized when scrolling chapters).

The code includes two different text files to show that the scroller works dynamically and isn't hardcoded to work with a specific text file size.

This project uses mainly function calls rather than hard coded to further show that this project runs dynamically. This shows that these functions can be utilized in other projects with minor changes made to them.

### Upon Launch:
- There is a menu that gives to user the option to Scroll Up, Scroll Down, Select, and Exit using U, D, a valid Integer, and X respectively
- The menu then opens again and presents the same options minus the Integer selection to allow the user to scroll through the chapter
